# aretext
Minimalist text editor that never slows you down.


## Project Status

* Important features are planned, but not yet implemented.
* Documentation has not yet been written.
* The user interface may change in fundamental ways.

See [open milestones](https://github.com/aretext/aretext/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open) for the current roadmap.


## Key Features

* Vim-compatible\* key bindings.
* Built-in fuzzy search for commands and files.
* Auto-reload when files are modified outside the editor.
* Fast and accurate incremental syntax highlighting.
* Intuitive yet powerful configuration in a single JSON file.
