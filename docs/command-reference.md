Command Reference
=================

This document lists every command in aretext.

All commands are compatible with vim keybindings, but not all vim keybindings are implemented. If you want to use a command that is not yet available, please consider contributing to the project!

Normal Mode Commands
--------------------

Some commands may be prefixed with a number *count* to repeat the command *count* times. For example "5x" deletes the next five characters.

Commands that interact with the clipboard accept a *clipboard page* prefix of the form `"[a-z]`, where the letter is the name of the page. If not provided, a default (unnamed) page is used.
