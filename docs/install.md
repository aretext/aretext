You can download the official binaries for Linux and macOS from [the aretext releases page](https://github.com/aretext/aretext/releases).

Build From Source
-----------------

If you have [installed go](https://golang.org/doc/install), then you can build aretext from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/aretext/aretext.git
cd aretext
make install
```

This will install aretext in `$HOME/go/bin`, which you can add to your `$PATH`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
```

Packages
--------

If a package is not yet available for your platform, please consider creating one! We are looking for package maintainers on Debian, Fedora, Homebrew, Nix, and any other platform you may prefer!

### Arch Linux

aretext is available as an [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aretext-bin/). If you use [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), run this to install it:

```shell
yay -S aretext
```
